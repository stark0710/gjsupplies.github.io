                Founded in 2024, GJ Supplies has come a long way from its beginnings. When we first started out, our passion for helping people be more eco-friendly and organized drove us to do intense research, and gave us the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over India, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the home goods industry.
            </p>
